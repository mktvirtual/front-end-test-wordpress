/**
* This is where Customizr starts. This file defines and loads the theme's components :
* => Constants : CUSTOMIZR_VER, TC_BASE, TC_BASE_CHILD, TC_BASE_URL, TC_BASE_URL_CHILD, THEMENAME, CZR_WEBSITE
* => Default filtered values : images sizes, skins, featured pages, social networks, widgets, post list layout
* => Text Domain
* => Theme supports : editor style, automatic-feed-links, post formats, navigation menu, post-thumbnails, retina support
* => Plugins compatibility : JetPack, bbPress, qTranslate, WooCommerce and more to come
* => Default filtered options for the customizer
* => Customizr theme's hooks API : front end components are rendered with action and filter hooks
*
* The method CZR__::czr_fn__() loads the php files and instantiates all theme's classes.
* All classes files (except the class__.php file which loads the other) are named with the following convention : class-[group]-[class_name].php
*
* The theme is entirely built on an extensible filter and action hooks API, which makes customizations easy and safe, without ever needing to modify the core structure.
* Customizr's code acts like a collection of plugins that can be enabled, disabled or extended.
*
* If you're not familiar with the WordPress hooks concept, you might want to read those guides :
* http://docs.presscustomizr.com/article/26-wordpress-actions-filters-and-hooks-a-guide-for-non-developers
