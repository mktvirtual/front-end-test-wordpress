= Snazzy Maps doesn't work with my Google Maps plugin! =

The Snazzy Maps plugin cannot apply styles to maps created using the Google Maps Embed API. This is because of 
fundamental limitations on the way IFrames work on the web. We cannot access the map within Google's IFrame and cannot 
apply any styles to it. Sorry! Switching to a WordPress plugin that uses Google's JavaScript API will work instead.

The following plugins will not work with the Snazzy Maps WordPress plugin:

- [Embed Google Map](https://wordpress.org/plugins/embed-google-map/)
- [Visual Composer](https://vc.wpbakery.com/)

If you happen to find any other map plugins that don't work please send us an email at support@snazzymaps.com.

= How can I access my favorites or private styles from SnazzyMaps.com? =

1. Sign up for an account at [SnazzyMaps.com](https://snazzymaps.com).
1. Click your email address in the top left corner.
1. Click the developer menu item on the left side.
1. Click the "Generate API Key" button.
1. Copy the long generated API Key.
1. Paste the key into the 'Settings' tab in the Snazzy Maps plugin.
1. You should now be able to access your favorites and private styles in the 'Explore' tab by changing the first filter dropdown.

== Screenshots ==
