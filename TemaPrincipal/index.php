						<a href="#"> A batalha por Zendikar</a>
						<h4>O plano de Zendikar</h4>
						<p>A umultuous plane of wild mana, unstable weather, and floating terrain, Zendikar is a world of incomparable natural beauty and danger. A dynamic plane, the landscape is affected by volatile seismic movements known as "the Roil," whose violent shifts make life there precarious, unpredictable, and full of adventure. <a class="continuelendo"href="#">Continue lendo...</a>

						<a href="#">Kozilek, a imensa distorção</a>
						<h4>Uma das três enormes eldrazis que assolam Zendikar</h4>
						<p>After the release of the Emrakul, Ulamog and Kozilek by Nissa Revane, Kozilek's brood was said to have retreated to remote corners of the world, and it was generally believed that he left the plane of Zendikar. However, this assumption appears to have been incorrect. Immediately after Ob Nixilis reignited his spark by draining the hedron network imprisoning Ulamog, Kozilek emerged from deep underground nearby. At that time, he had gained some perfect black shards floating above his head that seem to draw in light itself. They aren't objects, or even shapes — they are holes in space. <br><br>

After heavy initial losses in the Battle for Zendikar, the Gatewatch performed an orchestrated attack on Ulamog and Kozilek, binding them again in a web of leylines and burning them. This was the end of the material manifestation of Kozilek on Zendikar.</p>
